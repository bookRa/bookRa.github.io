### Hello there! ###

Please visit the links to the side (on mobile, the "Follow Me" dropdown above) to see my online content and portfolio.

Since 2016 I have been a software engineer, delivering full-stack applications in the cloud, focusing on data science APIs and machine learning technologies. In my last several positions I have built highly scalable applications on distributed service architectures. My interests lie in creating parallelized big data processing pipelines, and leveraging advanced machine learning libraries to drive business analytics and customer value. I love to collaborate within agile, fast-moving teams to design, develop and release production-ready products.
