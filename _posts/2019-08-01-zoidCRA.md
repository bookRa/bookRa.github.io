## Hello there! Today I will share a tutorial on how to create cross-domain React Apps.

{% include video id="DvthKymFznU" provider="youtube" %}

Have you every thought it would be cool if you could package a particular React (or Vanilla JS any other framework) component and display it on a different website, whether or not it was in the same framework?

Well, Paypal definitely thought of that a long time ago, because they wanted to put their Paypal button on as many merchant sites as possible!
![paypal](/images/paypalButton.png "Paypal Button")

They experienced a myriad of problems, though, which are well-documented in this [blog post](https://link.medium.com/1vd1OUYMEY) by the creator of [Zoid](https://github.com/krakenjs/zoid), Daniel Brain

If you have a similar task to accomplish (i.e. easily hosting cross-domain components in an I-frame), chances are you've come across the Zoid documentation, and their "[Login Button](http://krakenjs.com/zoid/demo/index.htm)" demos.

My issue with these simple demos is that they don't actually _show_ how you would use React _normally_ with Zoid. [Just this contrived jsx, `<script>`- using, `babel`-ified super simple example](https://github.com/krakenjs/zoid/tree/master/demo/frameworks/react). 

Admittedly, I likely don't have such a strong grasp of React compared with the paypal people, so I spent a long time puzzling over
> what about `import _ from '_'` instead of `<script>`??

> How do I make sure the correct component definitions load
at the right time?

etc.

So I answered some of these questions for myself and thought I'd share üòä

## Let's Begin!
*Note* source code for this tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/bookRa/zoid_tutorial)

We will start by creating _two seperately hosted React Applications_ using [Create-React-App ](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

So, in a common directory, run the following:
```bash
npx create-react-app parent-app;
cd parent-app;
npm i zoid
```
Of course this will take a while to get the app up and going (but how can you use React _without_ taking a long time to get up and going?). To make the child component is the same process. From the common directory:

```bash
npx create-react-app child-app;
cd child-app;
npm i zoid
```

Okay, next thing to do would be to edit the start script of the child app so it's not running on the same port. Open `child-app/package.json` and change the following line:
```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    ...
```
to
```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "PORT=2000 react-scripts start",
    "start": "set PORT=2000 && react-scripts start",// **if Windows:**
    ...
```
At this point you can run `npm start` from both app directories and get two simulatneously hosted ("cross domain") apps. Now is where the fun begins! 

(_side note_ I'd recommend changing the background color or something in one of the frames so you don't confuse yourself switching back and forth)

## Editing the Apps
I want to showcase the canonical example of React component communication. Namely:
> props down, events up

We want to pass two things from parent to child:
1) a value, `name` which is passed as a prop
2) a function, `passDownFunc` which when called from the child has an effect on the parent.

in `child-app/src/App.js` lets add the following lines:
```javascript
import React, {useState} from 'react';

function App(props){
    let [myWord, changeMyWord] = useState('')
    ...
    return(
        ...
       <p>
         Hello Im a beautiful widget!
        My name is <code>{props.name || "undefined"}</code>
        </p> 

        <input
        value={myWord}
        onChange={e=> changeMyWord(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button
        conClick={()=> props.passDownFunc(myWord)}>
        Pass this word up to parent
        </button>
    )
}
```
From the above, we know what 1) we will get a prop called `name` that we will render and a prop called `passDownFunc` that we will use to do _???_ depending on how the parent defines that function (but at least we know that it'll take a string as an argument).

The next step is to Zoid-ify this component/app that we've made - which we ill call `MyWidget`

Open a new file in `child-app/src` and call it `widget.js`:
```javascript
import * as zoid from "zoid/dist/zoid.frameworks";

let MyWidget = zoid.create({
    tag: 'my-widget',
    url: 'http://localhost:2000/index.html'
})

console.log('yo! have loaded mywidget from child: ')
console.log(MyWidget)

export default MyWidget
```

The console logs are optional, but allow you to see the type of MyWidget. Two __very__ important points to note:
1) If you're going to use React you _must_ import from `zoid/dist/zoid.frameworks`. See [this Github issue](https://github.com/krakenjs/zoid/issues/234) for more deets.
2) remember to put `/index.html` in your url. otherwise it fails!

Now, as this file isn't being _used_ anywhere, we'll have to import it into our app. And the place we import it is `index.js`!
```javascript
...
import MyWidget from './widget';
...
``` 
Yes, there's a good chance you'll get a liniting error
because `MyWidget` isn't used anywhere else in the file. That's okay.

Likewise, this `widget.js` is the "bridge" between our two
apps, so we'll **copy and paste** it into `parent-app/src`

**Important Note:** I know it's redic to C&P in a real-life situation.
There are ways to [import a `<script>` tag 
into a React Component](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34424845/adding-script-tag-to-react-jsx),
which I haven't tried, but you are more than welcome to üòÅ
I think it won't be difficult, but there may be some asynchronous/
lifecycle -type debugging to do (which is why I didn't try lol)

Anyway, whether you import or load the script via its `src`, 
the point is you want the zoid-created `MyWidget` to be available in your `parent-app/src/App.js`:
```javascript
...
import MyWidget from "./widget";
...
let MyReactWidget = MyWidget.driver('react',{
  React: React,
  ReactDOM: ReactDOM
})
...
function App(props){
    return(
        ...
        <MyReactWidget name="foobar" passDownFunc={()=> console.log("iFrame did something")}
    )
}
```

That is the crux of how you include a zoid component in your CRA app. After that I just added a little bit of fun stuff in `App.js` using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html):
(oh full disclosure I _did_ try to pass the child `name`
prop via an input element, but I was coming across problems with
re-rendering the iframe. Dunno if that's a legit issue
with Zoid, or if I'm just a n00b. So I did the prompt trick. )
```javascript
function App(props) {
  const [myThings, setMyThings] = useState(["burger", "fries"])
  let [widgetName, setWidgetName] = useState('')
  
  useEffect(()=> {setWidgetName(window.prompt("What's the child's name?"))}, [])

  const widgetFunc = word => setMyThings(myThings => [word, ...myThings])
  
  return (
```
  ```html
  {% raw %}
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          These are my things: {myThings.map((thing, idx) => {
            let randColor = Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16);
            
            return (<span 
            key={`thing${idx}`} 
            style={{
              color:`#${randColor}`,
              fontWeight: "bold"
            }}
            className="randomThing">{thing}; </span>)
        })}.
        </p>
        {widgetName && <MyReactWidget name={widgetName} passDownFunc={widgetFunc} />}
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
      
    </div>
  );
}
{% endraw %}
```

## Summary:
In order to go from a Create-React-App _Parent and Child_ to a CRA Parent and IFrame Child, the steps are as follows:

1. create the child app, making note of what props (including functions) it will get from the parent.
2. [Define the zoid component](http://krakenjs.com/zoid/docs/api.html#zoidcreate-options-)
in your child's `src` and import that file into your `index.js` to make sure the script loads.
    * make sure to `import * as zoid from "zoid/dist/zoid.frameworks"`
3. Import the same exact definition script into your Parent App
4. Use the React driver to turn the zoid component into a React Component
5. Render your React-ified component in your Parent App and it'll be an IFrame!

## Considerations
* There are a lot more advanced features in Zoid, not least of which is customizing size/shape/etc.
I've avoided mentioning those things b/c my focus is getting it to work with CRA.
* If your parent or child is non-React, it will still work (in fact there are probably less steps üòä)

Hope this helped. If you have any questions please let me know!
And a big thank you to [@bluepnume](https://github.com/bluepnume) and Facebook for 
their awesome work.
